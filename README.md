How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
   I start off by listing out the particular user needs, then analyzing them. I then ask myself certain questions: are there specific requests? how do I implement these requests in my code? This is exactly where user 
   stories come in. With user stories, you can section user requests and group them into tasks detailing what needs to be done and the importance attached to them.

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
   Having a plan to start tackling a problem is the first solution. For this project, I started with what I knew. Then I moved to what I had learned, incorporating it into what I already knew. This allowed me to begin 
   writing code. Poker planning and affinity grouping are two agile processes I like and can see working for me. Grouping tasks by importance, or perceived importance is something everyone does subconsciously being able to 
   apply that in a structured manner to projects will definitely be helpful.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
   Being a good team member in software development goes beyond technical skills and involves a combination of good collaboration, communication, professionalism, and a commitment to shared goals. When working with other 
   people, we function as machines that serve to assist one another in the tasks we perform. Being able to work in tandem with the rest of the team makes one a good team member in every right.
